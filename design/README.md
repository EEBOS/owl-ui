## Importing the Design

In order to create a dsp we first need to import the design file into the XD.

### Creating a Design

- Open Adobe XD and create a new file
- Add some `Text` to the canvas, select the text and add its color and character styles to the document assets.
- Save the file to the Creative Cloud
- Select the publish as a library button and click the publish button in the current file section
- Click the browse tab, then click the done button on the `Browse shared libraries`
- Go to the `Files` tab of the Creative Cloud portal and select the `Your libraries` section
- You should see a card of your file, hover over the card and click the menu icon then select the `share` option. You should see a modal open and a link being generated. **COPY** that link.

### Importing to VS Code

- Install the Adobe VS Code extension
- Open the extension `cmd + opt + x`. It may try to locate a dsp, just close the file explorer if it does
- Go to the `DSP settings`
- Paste the link into the `CC LIBRARY LINK` field and click import

## Using the Design

### Updating the DSP

- Go to the `DSP settings`
- Click the `Re-import` button of `CC LIBRARY LINK` field
- Click `Start Editing` then `Finish Editing`
